                        I'm Tyler Hand, and I'm a web application developer currently living in Portland, Oregon.  I love tehnology and learning new things, and I am always excited to try new things and work on new projects.  Currently, I work primarily on education based web applications for Multnomah Education Service District, dealing with clients such as school districts and other public agencies in the state of Oregon.  Outside of programming, I enjoy commuting by bike, watching soccer games, traveling to new places, and obsessing over old overlooked video games.

                    <p>Here are some projects I've worked on</p>
                    <h4><strong>SubDocs</strong> (Multnomah ESD)</h4>
                    <p>Subdocs is an application currently being developed to track substitute teachers and their work related documents throughout the school districts of Oregon.  Built to be more API based, as it will need to communicate with various other substitute teacher systems.  Uses PHP with Symfony for the backend that follows JSON API standards, and Ember.js for the frontend.  I have been the sole developer on the project thus far.</p>

                    <h4><strong>ORSkills</strong> (Multnomah ESD)</h4>
                    <p><a href="https://orskills.wesd.org">ORSkills</a> is a system to upload and score tests for a set of programs for both essential skills testing and dual credit testing.  Uses PHP with Symfony, and handles the upload and viewing of worksamples as PDFs, audio, video, and images.  I worked with anywhere from one to three other developers on the project, and my responsibilities were the media upload and playback, the scoring workflows, and various other components.</p>

                    <h4><strong>ORMed</strong> (Multnomah ESD)</h4>
                    <p>ORMed is a web application that tracks and bills medicaid services for special needs students in Oregon.  It also handles the information needed to validate medicaid bills, such as the IEP information, service provider recommendations, and medicaid elgibility.  I worked with another developer on the project, and my duties focused acrossed most of the project including the IEP component, the validation process, and various tools for service providers.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Hospital School Tracking</strong> (Multnomah ESD)</h4>
                    <p>An application that tracks student education time in the hospital school system.  Built on PHP with the Symfony framework.  I was the only developer on the project.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Disposition Code Manager</strong> (Fedex)</h4>
                    <p>A tool built as part of internship at Fedex.  Helps manage disposition codes for the package pickup system and the Customer Pickup Coordination system, and syncs the codes across various databases.  Uses Java and the Spring MVC framework.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Sandbox Application</strong> (Fedex)</h4>
                    <p>As part of my internship at Fedex, I built an internal application that used all the technologies that our main project (Customer Pickup Coordination System) used to serve as place where library upgrades could be tested without having to test on the full CPC.  It also served as a tool to train future new hires on frameworks and libraries used by the CPC team.  Built using Java and the Spring MVC framework.</p>

                    <h4><strong>History Fusion Prototype</strong> (School Project)</h4>
                    <p>A full term project I worked on with 8 other students for the University of Pittsburgh's History Department.  Built a basic proof of concept web application that takes various datasets from different contexts and allows a user to display comparisons and graphs between any datasets.  I met with the clients to collect business requirements, and helped work on the schema and dataset upload tools using PHP and Python.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Settlers of Catan Machine Learning Project</strong> (School Project)</h4>
                    <p>A full term project with 2 other teammates to analyze Settlers of Catan play data with machine learning to develop an AI player that used supervised learning to try and predict various moves by other players.  Built using an open source Java Settlers of Catan client.</p>
